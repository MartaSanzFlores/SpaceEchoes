# ðŸš€ SpaceEchoes Backend Symfony

## Description

This repository contains the **backend** for the SpaceEchoes web application. It is built using the Symfony framework and provides a RESTful API consumed by a separate React frontend.

The backend handles core features such as article management, image browsing, user interactions (likes, comments), and administrative moderation. It uses Doctrine ORM with MySQL for data persistence, and Twig/Bootstrap for rendering the admin panel.

The full application is the result of a collaborative one-month project involving four developers: two backend and two frontend. Development is ongoing to extend functionality and improve the overall system.

## Functional Overview

- **Articles Section**  
  Provides a collection of astronomy-related articles. Users can read, comment on, and report inappropriate comments. Admins can moderate these through the back-office.

- **Image Gallery**  
  Displays a gallery of captivating space images. Users can like and explore each image in detail.

- **Admin Back-Office**  
  Built with Twig and styled using Bootstrap, this panel allows administrators to review and moderate user content.
